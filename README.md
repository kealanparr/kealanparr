I like making and building things, with a range of technologies.

Currently a technical author on [CSS tricks](https://css-tricks.com/author/keaparr/), [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/author/kealan/), [Hacker Noon](https://hackernoon.com/u/kealanparr), [draft.dev](https://draft.dev/learn/publii-static-site-generator), [LogRocket](https://blog.logrocket.com/author/kealanparr/) and [dev.to](https://dev.to/kealanparr). My articles collectively have been read by more than 190,000 people for more than 20,000 hours.

Currently also a member in good standing of the [Unicode Consortium](https://unicode.org/consortium/consort.html).

Curious to learn more, build more and write more around tech & programming.

Some of the stuff I push is me just playing around with new tech. I use GitHub as a way to store my work, rather than write production code in every repo I do.

 Interested in reading, chess, finance and exercise.

I wrote a little more about my career and what I'm working on at the minute [here](https://developer-forge.com/about/)
