## Kealan Parr

I like making and building things, with a range of technologies.

Currently a technical author on [CSS tricks](https://css-tricks.com/author/keaparr/), [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/author/kealan/) and [dev.to](https://dev.to/kealanparr). My articles collectively have been read by more than 125,000 people for more than 10,000 hours.

Currently also a member in good standing of the [Unicode Consortium](https://unicode.org/consortium/consort.html).

Curious to learn more things with tech, play with new technologies and interested in reading, chess, finance and exercise.
